# what is this folder
its just a nodejs remote desktop server so i can see what im creating.
i use a remote tunnle on vscode.dev to work from school and its only ssh so i cant see my desktop
this will proubly get its own repo somtime in the future beacuse its quite usefull
yes i used ai to create most of this beacuse this is simply not what im working on right now
im focusing on my game engine
